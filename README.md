# LoCo Linux

This repository is adapted from the Kubos linux configuration (https://github.com/kubos/kubos-linux-build).  It contains an external configuration for Buildroot (https://buildroot.org/) that creates a disk image containing linux and the U-Boot loader for the Pumpkin MBM2 based on the BeagleBone Black single board computer.

The disk and linux image it creates is configured as follows:
* Disk Contents:
    * Master boot record (MBR):  Contains partuuid and partition table
    * Partition 1 (~16 MB): Boot (U-Boot binary, linux kernel binary, flattened device tree)
    * Partition 2 (~64 MB): Linux root filesystem (mounted as "/")
    * Partition 3 (2M): U-Boot environment variable storage.
    * Partition 4: Logical partition which encapsulates partitions 5 and 6
    * Partition 5 (~256 MB): U-Boot upgrade (*.itb) and environment storage (mounted as "/upgrade")
    * Partition 6 (~3000 MB): Rest of disk as ext4 (mounted as "/home")
    * NOTE: More than four requires the use of logical partitions.  It isn't a big deal, but this makes resizing the "/home" partition to fit the disk easier during installation.
* U-Boot
    * Configuration is identical to Kubos version (github.com/kubos/uboot) initially and will be modified for desired behavior soon.
* Linux
    * Kernel 5.4
    * User accounts:  The only user account is "root", which has no password
    * BusyBox provides most of the standard command line functions, but some additional executables are included (e.g. parted)
    * The BeagleBone will appear as a USB ethernet adapter when connected to host computer by USB.  The USB ethernet interface is configured with a static IP address: 192.168.7.2
    * The standard (RJ45) ethernet interface is configured with static IP address: 10.0.2.20
    * The debug console is on the BeagleBone's UART0 serial port.
    * Root filesystem contains key configurations:
        * /etc/default/dropbear: Configuration file to allow root login over SSH without password
        * /etc/dropbear/dropbear_ecdsa_host_key: Default SSH host key so it doesn't change each time loco-linux is installed
        * /etc/fstab.mmc*: Template mount tables for installation on mmc0 or mmc1.  One of these is copied to /etc/fstab during installation.
        * /etc/inittab: Configuration of init, which runs during startup and performs disk checks and other operations before monit is started
        * /etc/init.d:  Startup and shutdown scripts, e.g, Kubos script needed for tracking U-boot upgrade status, script that disables the user LEDs on startup, etc.
        * /etc/monitrc: Configuration of monit to manage services
        * /usr/sbin/install-os: Shell script used during installation of loco-linux on target device
    * Home partition:
        * A symbolic link at /var/log points to /home/system/log.  Monit stores its logs here.

The intent of loco-linux is to be able provide a redundant system with essentially identical primary and secondary disks, either of which is capable of fully running the operating system.  The BeagleBone boot select pin (GPIO 2_8, exposed as J133_4 on the MBM2) can be used to switch the order that the processor tries mmc1 and mmc0 on startup.  To provide redundance, the disk image should be installed on both the internal flash (mmc1) and the micro-SD (mmc0).  Only minor changes are needed to customize the image on each device:

1. Set a unique partuuid in the MBR on each device
2. Expand the /home partition to fill the full size of each device.  Devices mmc0 and mmc1 may have different sizes depending on the size of the micro-SD card used for mmc0.
3. Copy the appropriate /etc/fstab.mmc* file to /etc/fstab so that /upgrade (p3) and /home (p4) partitions are mounted from the same device as the root filesystem.

Each of these changes can be made by setting the optional arguments to the install-os script when it is executed to copy the disk image to the selected device.  NOTE:  Currently, U-Boot doesn't support completely independent operation.  It always tries to read its environment from mmc1, regardless of which device was used by the processor for startup.  We intend to modify U-Boot to correct this behavior.

## Installation

Download this repository by cloning it with git:

    $ git clone https://github.com/ASU-cubesat/loco-linux.git

Change directories to go inside loco-linux and run the setup script.  The setup script requires the board name as a command line argument and accepts several options.  Use ./setup.sh -h for details.  Typically, it is called as:

    $ cd loco-linux
    $ ./setup.sh -d -c pumpkin-mbm2

This will automatically download Buildroot and install it in the parent directory above loco-linux and add the loco-linux git hash to the compiled linux distribution (accessible at /proc/version on the target).   The only board currently supported is the pumpkin-mbm2.   The script regitsters the loco-linux directory with Buildroot using Buildroot's BR2_EXTERNAL make argument.

To start the build, change directories into Buildroot and call make:

    $ cd ../buildroot-2022.02.3/
    $ make

Buildroot will download all needed packages and compile.  The process can be lengthy and may take many minutes.

## Output

The principal output when the build completes will be in:

    buildroot-2022.02.3/output/images

Several files will be in this directory, but the three main output files are:

* os.img: Uncompressed disk image suitable for installing on an bootable (micro)SD card that can be used in the target device.
* os.img.gz: Compressed disk image suitable for copying to the target device and installing from an already running system.
* system.itb: Compressed partial disk image used by U-Boot to upgrade the boot (p1) and root filesystem (p2) partitions.  This can be copied to the upgrade partition (p3) of a target device that already has loco-linux running.  U-boot can then be used to install the upgrade.

## Installing onto the Pumpkin-MBM2 / BeagleBone

### Method 1: Bootable micro-SD card

1. Install the os.img file onto a bootable micro-SD card.
   * Note this image has the wrong disk partuuid for the SD card. This will be fixed later in the install.
2. Insert the card into the BeagleBone Black and power on the device.  Hold down any key during boot to enter into the U-boot command line terminal.
3. Enter the following:

        $ setenv bootargs console=ttyS0,115200 root=/dev/mmcblk0p2 ext4 rootwait; fatload mmc 0:1 ${fdtaddr} /pumpkin-mbm2.dtb; fatload mmc 0:1 ${loadaddr} /kernel; bootm ${loadaddr} - ${fdtaddr}

4. Enter "reset" to reboot
5. loco-linux should boot up, running from the micro-SD card (mmc0).
6. You should see the linux user prompt.  Enter "root".  There is no password.
7. After loggin in, the final step is to install loco-linux on the internal flash (mmc1):

        $ install-os -i /dev/mmcblk0 -o 1 -d -r

8. Reboot to the internal flash (mmc1). Hold space while rebooting to drop into the U-Boot terminal then execute:

        $ setenv bootargs console=ttyS0,115200 root=/dev/mmcblk1p2 ext4 rootwait; fatload mmc 1:1 ${fdtaddr} /pumpkin-mbm2.dtb; fatload mmc 1:1 ${loadaddr} /kernel; bootm ${loadaddr} - ${fdtaddr}

9. Run install os again but output to the SD-card

        $ install-os -i /dev/mmcblk1 -o 0 -d -r

    * This fixes the partuuid on the SD card note from step 1 and copies the correct fstab into /etc

### Method 2: Compressed disk image

If you already have linux (loco-linux or another reasonably functional linux) running on the BeagleBone, you can use the compressed image file to avoid having to use a micro-SD card.

1. Copy os.img.gz to the running linux on the target, make sure it is not on the disk (mmc0 or mmc1) that you want to overwrite.
2. Run the following, replacing \<target mmc\> with either 0 or 1 for micro-SD card or internal flash, respectively.

        $ install-os -i ./os.img.gz -o <target mmc> -d -r

### Method 3: U-Boot upgrade

To upgrade only the boot (partition 1) and root filesystem (partition 2) on an already running loco-linux installation, you can use the system.itb file:

1. Rename the file with a specific version number, e.g. system-1.0.1.itb
2. Copy the .itb file to the device and place it in /upgrade.  Note that the upgrade parition is fairly small and you made need to delete an existing older system.itb file to make room for the new one.
3. Set the U-Boot environment to tell it to install the new version on the next reboot:

        $ fw_setenv kubos_updatefile system-1.0.1.itb

4. Reboot
